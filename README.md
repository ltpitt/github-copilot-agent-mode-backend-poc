# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Backend POC

This repository is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for testing techniques to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode at its best for **Java Backend API development**. The goal is to leverage the power of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to rapidly develop a robust and efficient backend API.

## üéØ Project Purpose & Scope

This POC aims to experiment with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode capabilities in the context of Java backend development, specifically focusing on building APIs that serve real-world applications.

### Key Objective

Our **final goal** is to build an endpoint that performs **mortgage calculation** for a mortgage calculator frontend. This backend API will serve as the computational engine for the frontend application available at:

üîó **Frontend POC**: [github-copilot-agent-mode-frontend-poc](https://github.com/ltpitt/github-copilot-agent-mode-frontend-poc)

### What We're Building

- **Mortgage Calculation API**: A Java-based REST API that calculates mortgage payments, interest rates, and amortization schedules
- **Backend Service**: Robust Java backend following best practices for API development
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to seamlessly integrate with the Svelte-based mortgage calculator frontend

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Java** - Primary programming language for backend development
- **Spring Boot** - Framework for building production-ready applications (planned)
- **REST API** - For frontend-backend communication
- **Maven/Gradle** - Build and dependency management (to be determined)

## About GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

This project serves as a testing ground for exploring the capabilities and best practices of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode in Java backend development scenarios, particularly for API development and mathematical computations.
